# Laravel Starter Project

This is a fresh Laravel project. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Run `composer install` to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `php artisan migrate` to create the database tables.
3. Run `php artisan db:seed` to fill out the database with some dummy data.
4. Run `php artisan serve` to start the development server.

If you want to watch the scheduled tasks, you can run `php artisan schedule:list`.

After that, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and see the Laravel welcome page.
